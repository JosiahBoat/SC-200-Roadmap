# SC-200-Roadmap
Welcome to my personal study roadmap for the Microsoft SC-200: Security Operations Analyst certification.

I'm making this repo to help guide anyone that is studying for the SC200 Exam because I found many helpful resources that helped me.

This repo will include:
- My study plan
- Practice questions + Post exam tips
- Topic breakdowns (Sentinel, Defender XDR, KQL, and more)
- Resources and lab links
- My notes 

If you're preparing for SC-200 too, feel free to fork, clone, or contribute!
